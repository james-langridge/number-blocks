# Number Blocks

This is a PWA (progressive web app) mobile game built with React and TypeScript.

The player has to press the numbers in the correct ascending order.  When the next correct number is pressed, it turns green.  When the final number on the screen is pressed, the game resets, shuffling the position of the numbers.  The numbers are shuffled using the [Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle).  It can be played [here](https://visionary-scone-c0300a.netlify.app/).

It is designed for mobile, and is not optimised for larger screens.
